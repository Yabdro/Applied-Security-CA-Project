Setup internal network:
    - Go to settings on the VM, go to Network, select Internal Network, use standard 'intnet'
    - Startup VM, add following lines to /etc/network/interfaces:
    ```
    auto enp0s8
    iface enp0s8 inet static
        address 192.168.1.111
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 192.168.1.0
    ```
    - Repeat for every VM, using different addresses
    - `systemctl restart networking`
    - check network interfaces with `ip addr`
    - modify /etc/hosts file to have aliases for other VMs. like '192.168.1.112   Dakota' 
    - Now you can use e.g. 'ssh dakota@Dakota' to connect from one VM to other
    - For webserver:
        - Add second network interface with type 'Bridged Adapter', choose your systems NIC and
            You should be able to see the Webserver as a physiscal machine on your network
    - Remember the IP address of the webserver on your local network, then connect to it usign ssh or https
